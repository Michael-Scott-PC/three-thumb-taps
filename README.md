# three-thumb-taps
This is an effort to improve our faculty and staff's satisfaction when placing any order through our MiWorkspace service. 

The goal is to provide an order tracker to every customer that allows them to see the status of their order with only three taps of the thumb (or tapping mechanism of choice). The path to finding the status will be: email icon -> email containing tracker url -> click tracker url.

Our current process looks like such: 
  1. After we place the order, we place a "comment" in ServiceNow stating the order has been submitted, which automatically sends an email to the end user(s) stating the order has been placed with a lead time. 
  2. After the initial email, we have a 48 hour (business hours) standard of typing out an order status update into every order ticket. - Generally, every Monday, every order ticket in the Depot queue is updated. Then throughout the week as items filter in those individual tickets are updated. Wednesday and Friday is when the other bulk status updates usually happen.

The issues being solved: 
  1. The major flaw in this is human failure. If the person who placed the order is out of work for any reason, their customer orders may go unupdated past 48 hours. 
  2. For orders that have backordered parts and end up taking much longer than the average lead times, customers begin to wonder where their orders are and begin reaching out to us for updates - the 48 hour standard is no longer adequate when an order is going on 6-8 weeks on order.
